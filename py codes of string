1. Write a python program find the number of characters present in a string (with out using len())


counter = 0
str=input("enter the string")
for s in str:
      counter = counter+1
print("Length of the input string is:", counter)


2. Write a python program to count the number occurrences all vowels present in a string

counter = 0
str=input("enter the string")

vowels=0
number=0

for i in str:
      if(i=='a' or i=='e' or i=='i' or i=='o' or i=='u' or i=='A' or i=='E' or i=='I' or i=='O' or i=='U'):
            vowels=vowels+1

      elif(i=='0' or i=='1' or i=='2' or i=='3' or i=='4' or i=='5' or i=='6' or i=='7' or i=='8' or i=='9' ):\
          number=number+1

      else:
          pass


print("Number of vowels are:")
print(vowels)
print("Number of numbers are:")
print(number)


3. Write a python program to find common characters presents in two words

str=input("enter the string")
str1=input("enter the second string")



for i in str:
    for j in str1:
        if(i==j):
            print(i,end=" ")

4. Write a python program to check the given string is palindrome or not

a="gaurav"



b=  a.__len__()
c=a[::-1]
print(c)
if b==c:
    print(" yes it is palli")
else:
    print("no it is not")

5. Write a python program to convert alternate characters to capital letters


string ="hello this is gaurav"

for j in range(0,string.__len__()):
    if(j%2!=0):
        s=string[j].lower()
        print(s,end=" ")
    else:
        s1=string[j].upper()
        print(s1,end=" ")

6. Write a python program to read an IP address from stdin and check whether it is valid or not

''' 
ip=input("enter your id ")

a=ip.split(".")
for i in range(0, len(a)):
    a[i] = int(a[i])

print(a)

if(a[0]<=255) and (a[1]<=255) and (a[2]<=255)and (a[3]<=255) :
    print("yes this ip is in range")
else:
    print(" no this ip is not  in range")




Interface ethernet0 is up

Interface ethernet1 is down

Interface serial0 is down

Interface serial1 is up '''

7.1 Write a python program to find out how many interface are “up” (from the above input).


s="Interface ethernet0 is up Interface ethernet1 is down Interface serial0 is down Interface serial1 is up"
a=s.split(" ")
print(a)
c=0
for i in range (0,a.__len__()):
    if(a[i]=='up'):
        c=c+1
print(c ,"interfaces are up")



7.2 Write a python program print the interface names of all interfaces which are up.

s="Interface ethernet0 is up Interface ethernet1 is down Interface serial0 is down Interface serial1 is up"
a=s.split(" ")
print(a)

for i in range (0,a.__len__()):
    if(a[i]=='up'):
        print(a[i-2],"interfaces are up")
       




8. Write a python program to read a date (dd-mm-yyyy) and print the month name according the month number.

date=12
month=1
year=1997
if month==1:
    print(date,"jan",year)


9. Write a python program to reverse a string without using builtin methods



b=  a.__len__()
c=a[::-1]
print(c)
